* Here OOPS(Object-Oriented Programming) concept is discussed:

* OOPS:It talks about organizing code, especially how to create complex variables and define functions which acts on them.

1) Class: Class is a blueprint to organize the input data.
-> It helps us to represent real world related data as on entity.
   Syntax:
   class  Classname{
    constructor(property1,property2){
        this.property1=property1;
        this.property2=property2;
    }
    method1(){
        method logic
    }

    method2(){
        method logic
    }
   } 

* We create instance of class using the 'new' keyword followed by the class name and parantheses if the class has a constructor.
  Syntax:
  let instance=new Classname("data);

  Example:
   class student{
    constructor(name,age,grade){
        this.name=name;
        this.age=age;
        this.grade=grade;
    }

    displayInfo(){
        console.log("Name: " + this.name + ", Age: " + this.age + ", Grade: " + this.grade);   
    }
   }

  //creating instance of class student
  let student1=new student("Advik",5,"A");
  let student2=new student("Nishita",2,"B");

  //displaying information of each student
  student1.displayInfo();
  student2.displayInfo();
//output:Name: Advik, Age: 5, Grade: A
//       Name: Nishita, Age: 2, Grade: B
