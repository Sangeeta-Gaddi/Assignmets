* Here we discussed the topic HAVING clause:

* HAVING clause:This clause is used to filter out the groups.
-> The HAVING clause in MySQL is used to filter groups of data based on conditions. 
-> It is typically used with the GROUP BY clause to group rows based on one or more columns and then apply conditions to the grouped data.
-> The HAVING clause operates on grouped data and allows you to filter groups based on aggregate functions (e.g., COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX). 
Syntax:
SELECT column1, column2, aggregate_function(column3) AS alias
FROM table_name
WHERE condition  //filter rows before grouping
GROUP BY column1, column2
HAVING aggregate_condition; //filter out the gropus

* Difference between WHERE and HAVING clause.
* WHERE clause:
->Used before GROUP BY clause.
->Helps to filter rows.
->Cannot use aggregates in WHERE clause.

* HAVING clause:
->USED after GROUP BY clause.
->Helps to filter groups.
->Aggregates can be used to filter out groups.

Examples discussed using HAVING clause:
1) Give the batches and their average score for all batches with atleast three students
   SELECT batch_id,AVG(score)
   FROM students
   GROUP BY batch_id
   HAVING COUNT(id)>=3;

2) Find the average score of all the batches having atleast three students who score above 80.
   SELECT batch_id,Avg(score)
   FROM students
   WHERE score>=80;
   GROUP BY batch_id
   HAVING COUNT(id)>=3;

3) Find average unit_price of all products.
   SELECT AVG(unit_price)
   FROM products;

4) Find total number of quantity.
   SELECT SUM(quantity_in_stock)
   FROM products;

5) Find the status for every order.
   SELECT status, COUNT(order_id)
   FROM orders
   GROUP BY status;

6) Find total invoice per client or customers.
   SELECT COUNT(invoice_id)
   FROM invoices
   GROUP BY client_id;

7) Find the total invoice of client for only those clients who had more than two invoices.
   SELECT client_id,SUM(invoice_total)
   FROM invoices
   GROUP BY client_id
   HAVING COUNT(invoice_id)>2;

8) Find the total invoice per client
   Consider only those invoices which have payment date
   Find the total invoice of client for only those clients who had more than two invoices.
   SELECT client_id,SUM(invoice_total)
   FROM invoices
   WHERE payment IS NOT NULL
   GROUP BY client_id
   HAVING COUNT(invoice_id)>2;

9) Get customer_id, total number of items bought by each customer.
   SELECT O.customer_id,COUNT(order_id)
   FROM orders O
   JOIN orders_items OI
   ON O.orders_id=OI.order_id
   GROUP BY O.customer_id;

10) Get me the maximum orders ordered by customer.(consider above question)
    SELECT O.customer_id,COUNT(order_id)
    FROM orders O
    JOIN orders_items OI
    ON O.orders_id=OI.order_id
    GROUP BY O.customer_id
    ORDER BY COUNT DESC
    LIMIT 1;
