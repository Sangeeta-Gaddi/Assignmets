* Here introduction to Database is discussed.

* Database:It is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored electonically.
-> Database is a place which is used to store and manage large volume of information in a systematic way.It is a collection of related data.

* Data Base Management System(DBMS):It is software that facilitates efficient way to store and retrive data.

* Types of database:
1) Relational database.
2) Non-realational database.

1) Relational database:Type of database that organizes data into tables with rows and columns.
-> SQL(Structured Query Language) is used to interact with realational database.
-> Stored in table format.
-> It is collection of tables related to each other.

2) Non-realational database:Type of database often reffered to as NoSQL database.
-> It does not rely on the traditional tabular relationships.
-> It uses data models like document,key-value,columnar,graph etc to store and manage data.

* Properties of Relational Database:
1) Represent data in realted tables.
2) Every row is unique.
3) All of the values or data storing in column should be of same datatype.
4) Values or data in a cell should be atomic.
5) No two columns or fields can have a same name... etc

* Keys:A field or set of fields that can uniquely identify a row in a table.
-> A key is also called as Super key.
-> Types of keys:
1) Candidate key:A key of minimum size that can uniquely identify a row.It is a subset of a super key.
2) Primary key:One of the candidate key which is choosen by a database architect.
3) Composite key:It is a key more than two fields that uniquely identify a record in a table.
4) Foreign key:A field in a table that refers to primary key of another table.It establishes a relationship between two tables... etc
