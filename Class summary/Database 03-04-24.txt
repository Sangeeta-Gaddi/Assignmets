* Basic terminologies or terms related to databse:

1) Relation:A relation refers to a two-dimensional table consisting of rows and columns.
2) Attributes(field) of relation: It refers to columns of table.
3) Tuple(record):It refers to row of a table.
4) Degree of a relation:It refers to the number of columns or attributes in a table.
5) Cardinality of a relation:It refers to the number of rows on a table.

* Database Schema:It is also called as Schema design.
-> It defines the structure and organization of database,it deals with a design of database.
-> It serves as  blueprint for how the data is stored,accessed,and managed within the database system.
-> Schema design is all about structuring databse.
* It gives us below idea:
-> What are the different tables required to store data.
-> What are different attribute in each table.
-> What is the relationship  between any two tables.  
   and finally it gives a pictorial representation of database.

* How to approach schema design.
-> Go through the case study.
-> Collect the requriements.

* How to start modelling the schema.
1) Find all the entities from the requriements.(entity:anything for which we are storing multiple details).
-> Naming convention for tables:
* Prefer to have plural names for table.
2) There is need to establish the relationship between entities.
3) How to represent different cardinalities in a database.
-> 1:1 cardinality relationship-If we 1:1 cardinality relationship, then put the id of a table of your choice as goreign key.
-> 1:M or M:1 cardinality relationship-If we this type of cardinality relationship, put the id of 1's side as the foreign key of M's side.
-> M:M cardinality relationship:If we have this type of cardinality relationship, then we have to create new table to store the relationship.
   (We call such new tables as Mapping table or Lookup table).
