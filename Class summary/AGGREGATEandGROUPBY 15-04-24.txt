* Here we discussed some examples on JOINS, topics like AGGREGATE functions and GRUOP BY clause are discussed.

* Examples using JOINS:

1) If we want firstname and orderdate.
* USE databse name;
* Write the query:
  SELECT C.first_name, O.order_date
  FROM customers C
  JOIN orders O
  ON C.customers_id=O.customers_id;

2) Get the employee name and his manager or supervisior.
* USE database name;
* Query:
   SELECT e1.first_name, e2.first_name AS manager
   FROM employee e1
   JOIN employee e2
   ON e1.reports_to=e2.employee_id;

3) Get the customer name,product name which he ordered and order date when he ordered.
* USE database name;
* Query:
  SELECT C.first_name,P.name,O.order_date
  FROM customers C
  JOIN orders O
  ON C.customers_id=O.customers_id
  JOIN order_items OI
  ON O.order_id=OI.order_id
  JOIN product P
  ON OI.product_id=P.product_id;

* Agrregate Functions:These are the functions that perform a calculation on a set of values and return a single value. 
-> These functions are useful when you want to summarize data or perform calculations across multiple rows of data.
-> Some of the most commonly used aggregate functions in SQL include:
   COUNT,SUM,AVG,MAX,MIN

1) COUNT:Returns the number of rows in a result set. 
-> You can use COUNT(*) to count all rows. 
-> You can use COUNT(column) to count only the rows where the specified column is not NULL.
Syntax:
*SELECT COUNT(*) 
 FROM table_name;

*SELECT COUNT(column_name) 
FROM table_name;

2) SUM:Returns the sum of the values in a column. 
-> This function works on numeric data types.
Syntax:
SELECT SUM(column_name) 
FROM table_name;

3) AVG:Returns the average (mean) of the values in a column. 
-> This function works on numeric data types.
Syntax:
SELECT AVG(column_name) 
FROM table_name;

4) MAX:Returns the maximum value in a column.
Syntax:
SELECT MAX(column_name)
FROM table_name;

5) MIN:Returns the minimum value in a column.
Syntax:
SELECT MIN(column_name) 
FROM table_name;

* NOTE: In SELECT clause either have only column name or only aggregate functions, 
        Mixing aggregate functions and column name is not allowed.

* GROUP BY clause:
-> The GROUP BY clause in SQL is used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns into aggregated data, such as sums, averages, or counts. 
-> It is often used in conjunction with aggregate functions such as SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), MAX(), and MIN() to perform calculations on groups of data.
Syntax:
SELECT column1, column2, aggregate_function(column3)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1, column2;

* NOTE: If we have used the 'GROUP BY' clause then we can use both aggregate function with columns.
