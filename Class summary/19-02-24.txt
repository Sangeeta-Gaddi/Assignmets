In first class some basic topics are discussed:

* Understanding the definition of following terms.
1)Programming: Programming can be defind as the getting work done from computer.
2)Language: It is a set of rules to communicate with the computer.
3)Program: Set of instructions written using a programming language to perform specific task.

* Programming language should facilitates:
1)Data storage.
2)Action on data.
3)Emitting actions(Display output).

* Introduction to Javascript language.
1)Javascript: Javascriptis scripting language for web,it is used to create and control website dynamically.

2)Data Storage:It is defined as the methods and structures used to store and manage information(data) within the program.
  This includes variables,arrays,objects.

3)Variables:Refers to data storage, will helps to store the data.
Syntax: keyword variable (assignment operator) storing value
Example: let num=6;

There are diffrent types of variables in Javascript:
1.Numbers
2.String
3.Boolean
4.Array
5.Object

Ex: 1) var num=5;
       console.log(num); //output:5
       console.log(typeof(num));//output:number

    2)let str="Nishita";
      console.log(str); //output:Nishita
      console.log(typeof(str));//output:string

    3)const bool=false;
      console.log(bool);//output:false
      console.log(typeof(bool));//output:boolean

    4)var array=[1,2,3,4];
      console.log(array);//output:[1,2,3,4]
      console.log(typeof (array));//output:object

    5) let obj={name:"Nishita", age:21};
       console.log(obj);//output:{name:"Nishita", age:21}
       console.log(typeof(obj));//output:object  

Note: Once variable is created,if we want to reuse it then there is no need to use the keyword again before the variable.
      Ex: let num1=6;
          output=num1*num1;
          console.log(output);//output:36
