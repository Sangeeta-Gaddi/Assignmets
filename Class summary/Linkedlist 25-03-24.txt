* Here LinkedList topic is discussed.

* LinkedList:It is a data structure where each element is called as node, points to the next node in the sequence.
-> It consists of nodes where each node contains data and a reference to the next node in the sequence. This allows for dynamic 
  memory allocation and efficient insertion and deletion operations compared to arrays. 

Example:
class Node{
    constructor(name,phnum){
     this.name= name;
     this.phnum=phnum;
     this.next=null;
     }
    }
  let conct1 = new Node("Advik",9878645705)
  let conct2 = new Node("Nishita",9878654530)
  conct1.next = conct2;
  console.log(conct1.name);  //output:Advik
  console.log(conct1.next.name); //output:Nishita (will give name from conct2)
