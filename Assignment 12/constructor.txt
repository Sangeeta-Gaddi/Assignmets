*) What is constructor.

* Consstructor:
-> Constructor is a special method within a class that is called when an instance of the class is created. 
-> The constructor is used to initialize the object's properties (member variables) and perform any setup needed for the instance. It provides a way to set initial values for the object's state.

Example:
class Person{
    constructor(name,age){ //constructor to initialize properties
        this.name=name;
        this.age=age;
    }
    
introduce(){
    console.log(`Hi my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
}
}
let person1=new Person("Bob",25);
person1.introduce();
//output:Hi my name is Bob and I am 25 years old.
