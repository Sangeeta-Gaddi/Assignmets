*) What are member variables.

* Member variables:
-> Member variables also known as class properties or fields.
-> These are the variables that are associated with an instance of a class. 
-> They represent the state of an object and hold data specific to that object. 
-> Member variables are declared within the class, typically inside the constructor, and can be accessed and modified using the this keyword.

Example:
class Person{
    constructor(name,age){
        this.name=name; //member variable
        this.age=age;  //member variable
    }
}

let person1=new Person("Alice",30);

//access member variables
console.log(person1.name); //output:Alice
console.log(person1.age); //output:30
