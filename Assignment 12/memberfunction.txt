*) What are Member Functions.

* Member functions:
-> Member functions are also known as methods.
-> Are functions that are associated with a class. 
-> These functions define the behavior of objects created from the class. 
-> Member functions are declared within the class and can operate on the object's data (member variables).

Example:
class Person{
    constructor(name,age){
        this.name=name;
        this.age=age;
    }
    //member function
introduce(){
    console.log(`Hi my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
}
}

//use member function
let person1=new Person("Bob",25);
person1.introduce();
//output:Hi my name is Bob and I am 25 years old.
