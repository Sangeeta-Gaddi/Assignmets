*) What is the difference between global scope and local scope in Javascript.

* Global scope:Variables declared outside of any function or block are in the global scope.
->It defines the context where variables declared can be accessed from any function or block within the code.
->Global variables are accessible throughout the entire program, including inside functions and blocks.
Example:
let username="John"; //global variable

function greetuser(){
    console.log("Hello, " + username + " "); //access inside the function
}
greetuser();
//output:Hello, John 

console.log(username);//access outside the function
//output:John 
         
* Local scope:A variable is in local scope if it is defined inside a function.
->Local variables are only accessible within the function in which they are defined.
->Variables in local scope have limited visibility and don't affect variables outside the scope. 
Example:
function greetuser(){
    let username="John"; //local variable
    console.log("Hello," + username + ""); //access inside function
 }
 greetuser();
 //output:Hello,John

 console.log(username); //cannot be accssed outside function
 //output: username is not defined
