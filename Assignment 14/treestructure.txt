Q. What is the Tree data structure ? Why it is used.

* Tree data structure:
-> It is a data structure which is more opted to reprsent the hierarchical data.
-> Trees are composed of nodes.Each node has a value and a list of references to its child nodes.
-> Helps for efficient searching, sometimes insertion becomes easy.

* Some of the attributes of trees:
1) Root-It is the topmost node.from which all other nodes descend.
2) Parent node-It is a node that has one or more child nodes.
3) Child node-It is a node that is connected to a parent node.
4) Leaf node-It is a node that has no children.
5) Height of node-It is the longest path of node to any of its descendent leaf node
6) Nodes: Each node in a tree contains a value (or data) and may also have a link to other nodes (children nodes).
7) Edges: Edges are the links between nodes. They define the relationship and hierarchy between nodes
   .......etc

* Tree data structures are used for following reasons:
1) Used for Hierarchical Data Representation.
2) Provides Efficient Searching and Sorting.
3) Insertion becomes easy using tree data structure.
4) Helps in Navigation and Pathfinding.
5) Used for Memory Management.....etc
